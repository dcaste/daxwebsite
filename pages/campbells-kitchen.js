					<h3>Building Blocks of Content</h3>
					<p>
						I was part of the WordPress team in charge of developing the backend
						for this website. I did some small contributions in frontend but my
						main role was the development of the backend.
					</p>
					<p>
						This website was built before the WordPress Gutenberg editor was
						introduced and we used custom fields to build blocks of content,
						that way the Campbell's staff should have an user friendly way to
						update the information.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div className={styles.content}>
					<p>
						Because of scalability concerns the themes and plugins were built
						from scratch, that way other developers can modify them for future
						needs.
					</p>
					<p>
						The other consideration for this approach was security. We minimized
						the risks by avoiding third party plugins and coding under strict
						PHP and WordPress security standards.
					</p>

					<h3>Example of a Block of Content</h3>
					<p>
						One of my assignments was to build several custom blocks of content
						like the one you can see in this example. You could think of them as
						reusable components in React.
					</p>
					<p>
						This example is a caroussel with a collection of recipes. The
						administrator can add a maximum of 12 collections and each
						collection has its own name, description, a main image and two extra
						images. Once the user clicks on a collection she or he is taken to
						that specific collection of recipes, for example "Recipes Using
						Tomato Soup".

				<div className={styles.content}>
					<h3>API Integration</h3>
					<p>
						Another of my assignment was to integrate the reviews and scores
						coming from an external API. I also builted functionalities like
						sorting and adding new reviews by using AJAX. Yup, there was not
						such a thing as React back in the day ðŸ˜…
					</p>
					<p>
						Since there wasn't an average score for a given recipe I also built
						a simple average calculation for the recipe score.
					</p>

					<h3>SEO Structured Data</h3>
					<p>
						I was in charge of integrating the{' '}
						<a
							href='https://schema.org/'
							target='_blank'
							rel='noopener noreferrer'
						>
							https://schema.org/
						</a>{' '}
						structured data in the markup of the whole theme, especially in
						recipes, although it seems now Campbell's use a JSON file instead of
						the code in the markup.

				<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
				<p>
					This was my first time working with a big team with Agile method and
					remote colleagues. I learned a lot about coordinating efforts and
					distributing tasks.
				</p>
				<p>
					This was also my first time working in a massive WordPress website
					with an incredible amount of data. Granted, I was not in charge of
					migrating databases but I was part of the team building the backend
					for the new data.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was using Git environment in small personal projects but this was my
					first time to actually use it in a big project with several
					colleagues.
				</p>
				<h3>A problem solved</h3>
				<p>
					I would like to mention that I gave a valuable idea and solved a
					problem: we needed to show only the new versions of the recipes to the
					visitors but in case of not existing a new version we should present
					the old one.
				</p>
				<p>
					There were thousands of recipes and the Campbell's team was updating
					them one by one but we needed to show information, we could not wait
					for the whole update. So my idea was, instead of having a unique set
					of fields for the recipe data, we should have two set of fields: the
					old version fields and the new version fields. If the new version
					fields were empty, it means the recipe has been not updated yet so the
					website should use the old fields from the database, otherwise use the
					new fields.
				</p>
				<p>
					We tried my idea, we made a lot of tests and then it was approved to
					go live. That way the website showed thousands of recipes and then the
					Campbell's team was able to update the information at its own pace.
				</p>

				<h2>Further Development</h2>
				<p>
					The custom theme and blocks of content proved to be so useful that the
					client asked to develop other websites with the same approach, so we
					used the custom theme as a parent theme and the code from the blocks
					of content in the following Campbell's websites.
